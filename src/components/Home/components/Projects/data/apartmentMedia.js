        "description": `Elston—The street once known for its warehousing / manufacturing buildings has now become a Mecca for new condominiums.  The gentrification of the area is great, except that all of the condos are the same.  Now, it’s time for something different.
Feel the aura of an old warehouse building without sacrificing the benefits of new construction—welcome to the Elston Lofts.  Look up 12’ to the ceiling of your new condo, and view nothing but beautiful exposed timber, just like an old warehouse building.  While maintaining the look and charm of a loft, you can have peace and quiet thanks to soundproofing equivalent to concrete slabs.  At the same time, sunlight showers the units through large windows providing panoramic views.  All this located just 5 miles from downtown and minutes to the Kennedy expressway and CTA Blue Line.`,
